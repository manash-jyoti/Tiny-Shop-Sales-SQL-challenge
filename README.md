# Tiny-Shop-Sales-SQL-challenge

This repository contains the analysis performed on the data of a company called 'tiny shop' using SQL queries. The SQL statements address various business requirements and provide insights into the data. Here are the key takeaways and learnings from the analysis:

- The data analysis focused on answering specific questions about the products, customers, orders, and revenue of the 'tiny shop' company.
- The SQL queries were written using PostgreSQL syntax.
- Functions such as `COUNT`, `SUM`, `CONCAT`, `MIN`, `RANK`, `WITHIN GROUP`, and `CASE` were used to perform calculations, aggregations, and conditional evaluations while CTEs were used to optimize the performance of the queries.
- The analysis provided information about the product with the highest price, the customer with the most orders, total revenue per product, the day with the highest revenue, the first order for each customer, top customers with the most distinct products, the product bought the least in terms of quantity, the median order total, and categorizing orders as 'Expensive', 'Affordable', or 'Cheap'.
- The analysis demonstrates the use of common SQL concepts like joins, grouping, sorting, and subqueries to derive meaningful insights from the data.
- The queries can serve as a reference for similar analyses and can be customized or expanded to answer additional business questions.
- The README file serves as a documentation of the analysis, providing clarity on the questions addressed, functions used, and the overall approach.

Special thanks to Data Motion LLC for providing the SQL challenge and dataset for analysis. The exercise helped in developing SQL skills and gaining hands-on experience in data analysis using SQL.
